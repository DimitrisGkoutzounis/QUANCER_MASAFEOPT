# Multi-Agent Safe Bayesian Optimization on the Quasar Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of my Master's thesis, which extends the Safe Bayesian Optimization (SafeOpt) algorithm to a multi-agent setting, utilizing the Quasar platform for experimental validation. The work focuses on safe and efficient optimization in a cooperative control scenario.

## Key Contributions

- **Extension of SafeOpt**: Expands the Safe Bayesian Optimization framework to a multi-agent environment.
- **Multi-Agent Safe Learning**: Implements decentralized safe learning for multiple agents interacting in a shared control task.
- **Quanser Platform Integration**: Deploys and evaluates the approach on the Quasar platform for real-world experimental validation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitrisGkoutzounis/QUANCER_MASAFEOPT.git
cd QUANCER_MASAFEOPT
```

## Usage

Run the main optimization script:

```bash
python respective-experiment.py
```
